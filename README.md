Homework Block
--------------
Copyright Overnet Data Ltd.

Moodle has a powerful and extremely flexible course system that includes the 
ability to set assignments for learners. However the very flexibility of this 
system makes it difficult and time consuming to understand and use. A simpler 
homework system that integrates into the existing assignment framework is the 
number one request from our customers, so this plugin is the result.

This is a free plugin for Moodle that wraps the use of the Moodle Assignment 
Activity module in a more user friendly UI, hiding the features that most users
do not use, whilst adding some additional features such as learner notifications
of new assignments and detailed reporting.

When used in combination with our commercial product EduLink for Moodle, various
additional features become available, for example achievement and behaviour 
writebacks when marking homework and parental notification of homework 
assignments being set.

Features
--------

Admin and Teachers can:

* Easily set, edit and mark homework assignments
* View reports of homework usage, group and individual grades
* Be notified by Moodle message when homework is set

Learners can:

* See all their homework assignments in one place including due dates and status
* Submit work online or mark 'non-submitted' assignments as done
* Be notified by Moodle message when homework is set

Parents can:

* Be notified by email when homework is set (EduLink for Moodle required)
* View their children's homework assignments including due dates and status

Requirements
------------

* Moodle version 2.9 or above
* (optional) EduLink for Moodle version 6.2.145 or above

Installation
------------

Within the ZIP file is a folder named homework, copy this folder into
your Moodle blocks folder (e.g /var/moodle/htdocs/blocks/ ). Once the folder
has been copied into your blocks folder, login to Moodle as admin and it should
detect the new block and install it.

Note that if you download the ZIP from Github the homework folder is called
'moodle-block_homework' and needs to be renamed after extraction to 'homework'.

Once installed you can add the block to your front page in the usual manner,
and we recommend you set it to appear on all pages.
